The Target Network is updated periodically (e.g., every C steps) by copying the weights of the Q-Network.\\n3. **Error Clipping**: This is a technique used to prevent exploding gradients in DQN by clipping the error term (the difference between predicted and target values) to a certain range (-c, c).\\n\\nThese three components are crucial for stabilizing the training process and improving the performance of deep Q-networks.\""
